Reason for Exam: Bronchiectasis. 

 CT HIGH RESOLUTION CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: 

 Comparison made with previous study from 4/4/11. 

 TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images obtained through the chest without 
 contrast. Additional high resolution thin sliced images at 
 selected intervals through the chest were obtained during both 
 inspiration and expiration as well as in the prone position. 

 FINDINGS: Again seen are changes of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis 
 which is basilar predominant and demonstrates peripheral and 
 basilar areas of honeycombing. Bronchiectasis is noted also with 
 mid and lower lung predominance. There is no significant air 
 trapping identified. Imaging in the prone position demonstrates no 
 anterior airway trapping. There is both interstitial and 
 centrilobular thickening. No significant centrilobular nodules are 
 identified. No significant ground glass air space disease in the 
 mid and upper lungs. No dense air space consolidation. No 
 pneumothorax or effusion. 

 Changes of prior median sternotomy for bypass grafting noted. 
 Stable prominent mediastinal and hilar nodes are present, but do 
 not meet CT size criteria for adenopathy. These are commonly seen 
 in underlying changes of pulmonary fibrosis as well as within CHF. 
 There is marked cardiomegaly. Partial imaging of upper abdomen is 
 unremarkable. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Essentially stable changes of pulmonary fibrosis with 
 peripheral and basilar honeycombing and mid and lower lung 
 predominant bronchiectasis. Pattern most consistent with changes of 
 UIP likely in the clinical setting of IPF. 
 2. Marked cardiomegaly with prominence of the pulmonary 
 interstitium which may also represent concurrent changes of 
 interstitial edema.
 3. Prominent mediastinal nodes which are likely reactive. No 
 adenopathy by CT size criteria.
