Reason for Exam: Follow up pulmonary nodules. 

 CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: 

 Comparison is made from previous CT abdomen and pelvis from 
 8/4/2011. 

 TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images obtained through chest without contrast. 

 FINDINGS: Calcified hilar and mediastinal nodes consistent with 
 prior granulomatous disease. Calcified atherosclerotic changes of 
 the aorta with pulmonary vascular calcifications. Trace pericardial 
 fluid probably physiologic. No pleural effusions. There is no 
 thoracic adenopathy by CT size criteria. Partial imaging of upper 
 abdomen demonstrates low density lesions of the liver most 
 consistent with benign cyst versus hemangioma. No change in their 
 density. 

 Lung windows demonstrate no change in a 4 mm noncalcified nodule 
 anterior right lower lobe along the major fissure. This may 
 represent a fissural lymph node versus a small nonspecific nodule 
 within the parenchyma. Continued follow up recommended in six to 
 eight months. The previously described nodule in the right middle 
 lobe on today's exam appears to represent area of linear scarring. 
 Scarring also noted medial right medial lobe as well as lung 
 apices. Advanced centrilobular emphysema is noted. No large 
 pulmonary masses or significant air space disease identified. No 
 pneumothorax. 

 Bone windows demonstrate no acute osseus changes. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Stable right lower lobe pulmonary noncalcified nodule which 
 may represent fissural nodule versus parenchymal nodule. 
 2. Continued follow up recommended to document stability. 
 3. Linear scarring right middle lobe with no discrete nodule 
 identified. 
 4. Advanced centrilobular emphysema with area of scarring but 
 no acute intrathoracic findings. 
 5. Calcified atherosclerotic changes and coronary vascular 
 calcifications.
