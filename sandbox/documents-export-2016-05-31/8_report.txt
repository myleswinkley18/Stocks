Reason for Exam: Persistent x-ray abnormality right lower lung, 
 possible pneumonia. 

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: 

 TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial CT images obtained through the chest 
 after 85 mL IV Isovue 300 contrast administration. 

 FINDINGS: No pleural or pericardial effusions. No thoracic 
 adenopathy. Calcified left hilar nodes. Prominent right 
 epicardial fat which appears to account for x-ray findings. No 
 definite right middle lobe or right lower lobe air space disease or 
 abnormalities. Linear atelectasis in the lingula. Small 3 mm 
 noncalcified nodule right upper lobe periphery most consistent with 
 a noncalcified granuloma. Follow up exam in six months to document 
 stability. Lungs otherwise clear. Imaging of the upper abdomen 
 demonstrates fatty infiltration of liver. Upper abdomen otherwise 
 unremarkable. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Prominent right epicardial fat accounting for abnormality on 
 x-ray. No pneumonia or acute intrathoracic findings. 
 2. 3 mm noncalcified pulmonary nodule right upper lobe most 
 consistent with noncalcified granuloma. Six month follow up 
 recommended to document stability. 
 3. Fatty infiltration of liver, otherwise unremarkable exam.
