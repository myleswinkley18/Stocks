Reason for Exam: Shortness of breath, cough, history of squamous 
 cell head and neck cancer. 

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: 

 No prior studies are available for comparison. 

 TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images are obtained through the chest after 80 
 ml of IV Isovue 300 contrast administration. 

 FINDINGS: There are too numerous to count rounded pulmonary 
 lesions throughout all lobes both lungs. Highest concentration 
 appears to be along the bases suggesting a possible hematogenous 
 spread of disease. Nonetheless, findings are most consistent with 
 pulmonary metastatic disease. Centrilobular emphysema is present. 
 Changes of prior median sternotomy for CABG. There is cardiomegaly 
 with coronary calcifications. Calcified and noncalcified 
 atherosclerotic changes of the thoracic aorta are noted without 
 aneurysm or occlusion. There is thoracic adenopathy by CT size 
 criteria. There are no central lesions that constrict or obliterate 
 the bronchovascular bundles within the hilar aspects. No pleural or 
 pericardial effusions. Partial imaging of upper abdomen demonstrates 
 calcified and noncalcified atherosclerotic changes and cholelithiasis.
 Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic osseus lesions. Mild
 degenerative changes lower thoracic spine. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Diffuse, bilateral, too numerous to count pulmonary lesions 
 consistent with metastatic disease. 
 2. No central constricting or obliterative lesion within the hilar
 stations. 
 3. Cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic changes. 
 4. Cholelithiasis. 
 5. Findings were discussed with Beverly Holbert, referring nurse 
 practitioner, at 2:30 p.m. on 8/4/2011.
