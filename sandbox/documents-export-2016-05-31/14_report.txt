Reason for Exam: Fall, thoracic pain and abnormality on CT 
 cervical spine. 

 CT CHEST WITHOUT CONTRAST: 

 TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images obtained through the chest without 
 contrast. 

 FINDINGS: Small low density and homogeneous fluid collection 
 situated between the brachiocephalic artery and the SVC in the 
 anterior mediastinum. This may represent a developmental cyst, or 
 may be related to extension of fluid from the aortic recess. An 
 atypical bronchogenic cyst could also be considered. No high 
 density fluid collections within the mediastinum. Coronary 
 vascular calcifications with mild cardiomegaly noted. 
 Granulomatous changes of the left hilum. There is no hilar 
 adenopathy. No mediastinal or axillary adenopathy by CT size 
 criteria. Changes of chronic atelectasis left greater than right 
 bilateral lower lobes with associated scarring. Volume loss noted. 
 Lungs are otherwise clear. No effusion or pneumothorax. Partial 
 imaging of upper abdomen unremarkable. Bone windows demonstrate no 
 acute osseous findings. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1. No acute intrathoracic findings identified. 
 2. Homogeneous 3 cm fluid collection within the superior 
 mediastinum contiguous with the aortic recess may represent 
 pericardial fluid versus developmental cyst. Follow up is 
 recommended in four months with CT to document stability. 
 3. Bibasilar scarring and areas of probable chronic atelectasis 
 as detailed above.
