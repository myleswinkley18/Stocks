Reason for Exam: Dyspnea and shortness of breath. 

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: 

 TECHNIQUE: Multiple axial CT images were obtained through the 
 chest after 85 mL of IV Isovue 300 contrast administration. 

 FINDINGS: Calcified mediastinal and left hilar lymph nodes are 
 noted consistent with post granulomatous changes. There is no 
 thoracic adenopathy by CT size criteria. No pleural or pericardial 
 effusions. Imaging of the upper abdomen is unremarkable except for 
 calcified splenic granulomas. Minimal coronary vascular 
 calcifications are present. 

 Lung windows demonstrate areas of apical scarring as well as linear 
 scarring within the lingula. Advanced centrilobular emphysema is 
 noted. Subpleural fibrosis is present, but there are no focal 
 parenchymal lesions of the right lung. Calcified granuloma left 
 lower lobe is noted. A small subcentimeter noncalcified nodule 
 peripheral basal aspect left lower lobe also present most probably 
 representing noncalcified granuloma. Follow up of this lesion is 
 recommended in six months. No additional nodules are identified. 
 No parenchymal air space opacities. Conglomerative fibrosis noted 
 of the medial left lung apex with no measurable mass lesion 
 identified. There is no pneumothorax. 

 Bone windows demonstrate degenerative changes of the thoracic 
 spine. No acute osseous findings are identified. 

 IMPRESSION: 
 1. Advanced centrilobular emphysema. 
 2. Post granulomatous changes with calcified granulomas. 
 3. Areas of peripheral pulmonary scarring and apical scarring 
 with fibrosis. 
 4. Nonspecific noncalcified nodule left lower lobe, 5 mm, for 
 which follow up CT in six months is recommended.
